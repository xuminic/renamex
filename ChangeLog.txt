20160802:
	* config.h: have it removed because it's not really used.
	Modified other files that relates to config.h

20160801: Version 2.3
	* Makefile: Updated in Windows and dual-GTK distrobution.
	* Makefile: simplest installer to the freedesk desktop.

	Note that in dual GTK system the GTK3 is the default. 
	It can be overrided by prefix "USE_GTK2=1" to make

20160728:
	* mmgui.c: fixed the missing Ctrl-A in Windows.

20160727: Version 2.2

20160720: release 2.0
	* iup/iup_list.c: The Temporary patch can be removed. In iListGetNaturalItemsSize():846:
	  *h += 2*ih->data->spacing;  /* this will be multiplied by the number of lines */
	  *w += 2*ih->data->spacing;  /* include also horizontal spacing */
	changed to
	  /* 20140505 A.Xuming: Temporary solution to go around the IupList too short issue */
	  *h += 2*ih->data->spacing + 1;  /* this will be multiplied by the number of lines */
	  *w += 2*ih->data->spacing;  /* include also horizontal spacing */
	to workaround the IupList can not go to the bottom items. It seems
	fixed above 3.10

20160717:
	* rename.c: remove the overwrite option totally.
	You don't want anything being accidently overwritten by a rename tool.
	If you want, you need to use other tools. Rename tool is not 'mv'
	or 'cp'. It does simply change filenames. If the target file is
	already existed, renamex simply gives up.
